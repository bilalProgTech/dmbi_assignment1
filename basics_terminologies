Q.1) What is Machine Learning?
      Machine learning enables computers to act and make data-driven decisions rather 
      than being explicitly programmed to carry out a certain task.
Q.2) What is Data Science?
      Data scientists combine statistics, mathematics, programming, problem-solving, capturing data in ingenious ways, 
      the ability to look at things differently to find patterns, along with the activities of cleansing, preparing, and 
      aligning the data.
Q.3) What is Data Mining?
      Data mining is the process of sorting through large data sets to identify patterns and establish 
      relationships to solve problems through data analysis. 
Q.4) What is Data Analytics?
      Data Analytics is the science of examining raw data with the purpose of finding patterns and drawing 
      conclusions about that information by applying an algorithmic.
Q.5) What are the tools used for the Data Mining?
    *Tools are as follows:
      -> WEKA:  Weka is a Java based free and open source software licensed under the GNU GPL 
                and available for use on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It includes visualization 
                and predictive analysis and modeling techniques, clustering, association, 
                regression and classification
      -> R-Programming Tools: This is written in C and FORTRAN, and allows the data miners to write 
                              scripts just like a programming language/platform. Hence, it is used 
                              to make statistical and analytical software for data mining.
      -> Python based Orange: Python is very popular due to ease of use and its powerful features. 
                              Orange is an open source tool that is written in Python with useful 
                              data analytics, text analysis, and machine-learning features embedded 
                              in a visual programming interface.
Q.6) Explain the Limitations of the tools which you have listed in the above questions answer.
      -> WEKA
          *_  In Clustering algorithm, it is sometimes difficult to compare the quality of the clusters produced.
      -> R-Programming Tools
          *_  R is a slow programming language: This tends to be one of the recurrent complaints 
              mentioned by developers when asked about the drawbacks of programming with R.
      -> Python based Orange
          *_  Python doesn't have good documentation: Some programmers complain about the lack of good documentation 
              for Python, particularly compared to other programming languages like PHP and Java.
Q.7) What are the tasks in the Machine Learning?
      -> Regression:  The aim is to predict the value of a continous response variable.
      -> Classification:  If we have data, say pictures of animals, we can classify them. This animal is a cat, 
                          that animal is a dog and so on. A computer can do the same task using a Machine Learning 
                          algorithm thatâ€™s designed for the classification task.
      -> Clustering: Clustering is to create groups of data called clusters.
Q.8) Give at least 5 examples of the tasks which you have given in above question.
      *Regression:
        ->Kernel regression
        ->Regression trees
        ->Linear regression
        ->Support vector regression
      *Classification:
        ->K-Nearest Neighbors
        ->Decision trees
        ->Naive Bayes
        ->Deep learning
        ->Boosted trees
      *Clustering:
        ->Mean-shift
        ->Hierarchical clustering
        ->K-means
        ->Topic models
